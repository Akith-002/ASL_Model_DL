# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the ASL Alphabet Recognition project! Contributions make the project better for everyone. Below are some guidelines to help you get started.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository and create a branch for your change:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```

2. Make your changes and add tests where appropriate.

3. Keep changes small and focused. Update `README.md` if you add new scripts or features.

4. Run basic checks locally (linting, test notebook execution) before opening a pull request.

5. Open a Pull Request describing the change and why it's useful.

## Issues

- If you find a bug, open an issue and include steps to reproduce.
- If you'd like to propose a feature, open an issue with a short rationale and example.

## Coding style

- Follow PEP8 for Python code.
- Add docstrings to new functions and modules.

## Data and Models

- Do not upload datasets or large model files to the repository. Use cloud storage or release assets and provide download instructions in the README.
